# *moparse* - Modelica language parser

**This crate is no longer maintained. Parser was included directly into
[mofmt](https://github.com/ErykMroczek/mofmt). Any further development will
happen there**.

*moparse* is a parser for the [Modelica](https://modelica.org/) language.

I have created it to use it as a crate/library in my other tools like
[mofmt](https://github.com/ErykMroczek/mofmt). Maybe it will be useful
for you as well.

The parser is working more or less correctly, but it is very much work
in progress, so every version may bring breaking changes.
